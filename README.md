# Yakubco Games

This is a repository of a one man trying to learn something and entertain himselve and hopefully other people as well. The web environment was chosen for ease of distribution so people can see it. Real world application is running on [games.nohavovi.cz](https://games.nohavovi.cz/).


## Content

**1. Dodge 'em**

- Truly skill-based game.
- Collect as many as possible coins while avoiding moving projectiles.
- You have _"teleport"_ and short _"protection by higher forces"_ to your advantage but you will die anyway. 

**2. Easy Little Puzzle**

- Logic puzzle game.
- 3 rotatable cylinders each with different color and 4 places for stones. Goal is to get all stones to their corresponding cylinder using rotation of the cylinders.
- Click on cylinders to rotate them or click on the stones to move them instead.

**3. Evil Polygons**

- Skill-based arcade.
- Shoot all of the enemies and win. There are 2 types of enemy for now: **Shooter**, **Eater**. Shooter just sits and shoots and Eater is trying to eat you, so he will chase you and chase you till you die.
- Move by *'w' 'a' 's' 'd'*, aim with your mouse and shoot them all.

## Bugs

If you find bug, which you will, there is an option to open an issue for this repository so I can take a look at it. But most likely I won't notice :} I am doing it in free time.
